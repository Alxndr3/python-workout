"""Create a Phone class that represents a mobile phone. (Are there still
nonmobile phones?) The phone should implement a dial method that dials a
phone number (or simulates doing so). Implement a SmartPhone subclass
that uses the Phone.dial method but implements its own run_app method.
Now implement an iPhone subclass that implements not only a run_app
method, but also its own dial method, which invokes the parentâ€™s dial
method but whose output is all in lowercase as a sign of its coolness."""
