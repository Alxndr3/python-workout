"""Itâ€™s sometimes useful to transform data from one format into another.
Download a JSON-formatted list of the 1,000 largest cities in the United States
from http://mng.bz/Vgd0. Using a dict comprehension, turn it into a dict in
which the keys are the city names, and the values are the populations of those
cities. Why are there only 925 key-value pairs in this dict? Now create a new
dict, but set each key to be a tuple containing the state and city. Does that
ensure there will be 1,000 key-value pairs?"""
