"""Write a version of the flatten function mentioned earlier called flatten_odd
_ints. Itâ€™ll do the same thing as flatten, but the output will only contain
odd integers. Inputs that are neither odd nor integers should be excluded.
Inputs containing strings that could be converted to integers should be
converted; other strings should be excluded."""
