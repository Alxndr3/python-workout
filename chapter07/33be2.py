"""Use a dict comprehension to create a dict in which the keys are usernames
and the values are (integer) user IDs, based on a Unix-style /etc/passwd file.
Hint: in a typical /etc/passwd file, the usernames are the first field in a row
(i.e., index 0), and the user IDs are the third field in a row (i.e., index 2).
If you need to download a sample /etc/passwd file, you can get it from
http://mng.bz/ 2XXg. Note that this sample file contains comment lines, meaning
that youâ€™ll need to remove them when creating your dict."""
